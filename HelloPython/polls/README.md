<ul>
  <li>Database</li>
  Instead of the suggested SQLite I decided to use MySql for the database.
  <li>Race Condition</li>
  The race condition fix has been implemented, in the library it is reffered as F() object
  <li>Tests</li>
  Test.py is complete after the example from the Django website, code is very similar if not exactly the same. Test file is not fully functioning yet.
